exception:A way of handling errors present in most modern languages. When an error occurs, the program stops where it is and throws the error back to the place that called the current function, until the error is caught (usually with a try/catch block), or it reaches the main function and crashes the program. This replaces the C style of error handling where a function just sets an error code variable that the programmer has to manually check after every function call.
encapsulation:Encapsulation is the isolation of code so that it can be used but not accessed or modified directly. One example of encapsulated code is a function.
binary tree:A binary tree is a tree where each node can only have at most two children. Because at any given node you only have two children to operate on, code written for a binary tree is generally very simple.
metadata:Metadata is the data about the data
stack:There are two main uses of the term "stack". One is a data structure: A stack is a collection of items that lets you insert ("push") and remove ("pop") one item at a time, and sometimes view the top item without removing it ("peek"). The last item you insert is the first item you remove; this is called "last in, first out" or "LIFO". Think of a stack of papers. Pushing is like placing a sheet of paper on top, and popping is like removing a sheet from the top. The other is the call stack (sometimes just "the stack"), which is the area of a computer's memory that stores the local variables, function arguments, and functions that have been called. It is one example of the stack data structure.
backup:the steps taken to copy the state of a system so that it can be restored to that state at some later time.
foreign key:In a relational database, a foreign key is a link from one table row to another by storing a primary key. When Table A references a row in Table B by its primary key, Table A is storing a foreign key.
debugger:A tool, typically built into the IDE these days, that allows the developer to set breakpoints and examine the state of the code, variables, classes, memory and visual interface while the code is executing to determine where errors are occurring.
polymorphism:Polymorphism is a concept often used in Object-Oriented Programming where two different classes share a common interface. Although it also exists in other programming paradigms, it is most common in Object-Oriented Programming. The caller of a function doesn't need to know the exact implementation of a function, it only needs its name and the required arguments.
ui ux:UI refers to the user interface. This is the front of a program that a user interacts with.UX stands for User Experience. Enhancing the UX for example could mean something like streamlining the site to make navigation quicker.
end user:An end user is the client that actually uses the application to meet a business or personal need. They are called an "end" user to indicate that their interactions with the application lie at the end of the development process. A "user" could be anyone that uses the application at any point of the development process.
hacking:Generally, "hacking" refers to the process of intentionally breaking a software or using it for a purpose it wasn't intended for. Hacking can be performed for benevolent reasons, in which case it's described as "white hat". For example, a company may hire hackers to find vulnerabilities in their application so that they may patch them before a bad actor (a "black hat") finds and and exploits them. "Hacking" is relevant on the global stage in the context of "cyberwar" and, and society becomes more reliant on technology, more people will be affected by a widely-used service being hacked.
indentation:Adding whitespace to the beginning of lines of code to make the structure clear. For example, the code inside a loop is usually indented from the surrounding code to show that it is part of the loop. Indentation may be achieved with tabs or spaces, and there is a debate (not entirely serious) about which is better.
java:Java is an object-oriented programming language. It is a popular choice for both software development and web development alike. Part of Java's appeal is that it compiles into bytecode which runs on the Java Virtual Machine, sort of like a mini-operating system that runs on top of your own OS, so that Java developers can "write once, run anywhere" (though devs joke that this more often translates to "write once, debug everywhere"). The JVM also handles garbage collection.
captcha:Acronym for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart". It is those annoying messed up graphics of text that you have to read and type in to prove to the web page you are not a bot.
else:Else is the opposite of IF. Else is the function that runs if the IF condition(s) are NOT true. IF health points are greater than 1, continue battle. ELSE show game over screen.
qr code:A two dimensional barcode that can have a very high density and has a the ability to survive a degree of destruction (intentional as with overlay art or unintentional as with stains or destruction) and still be readable. QR codes are commonly used to encode URLs as a form of advertising and unlike one dimensional barcodes are expected to be read by cameras (common in smartphones) as opposed to lasers (more common in manufacturing and retail).
xml:XML is a markup language (like HTML) that stores data in nested tags (ex: <outer><inner>data</inner></outer>) - XML is most often used to transfer information between applications (via an API). Many markup languages have been built off of this, such as musicXML for music notation software.
interrupt:Interrupts are a means to react to asynchronous events in a very low-level manner. Interrupts are managed by the cpu, and enable the interruption (hence the name) of a running process to execute a registered "interrupt handler" which is a function of that process specifically designed to deal with the interrupt.
dijkstra's algorithm:A way of finding the shortest path between two points. Starting at point A (your origin), look at all nearing points, calculate the distance to them, and mark point A as visited. Then, keep repeating the exact same for the non-visited point with the lowest distance, until point B (your destination) is marked as visited. Although it is guaranteed to find the shortest path, the algorithm's speed can be improved with heuristics, which is the base for the A* algorithm.
html:Hyper Text Markup Language, commonly HTML, is the main way to get text, images, and other elements onto a page. Almost any content-rich webpage you see on the web that has text is defined with HTML. HTML includes some basic formatting, like header sizing and bold/underlined/italic text, but styling on the web is generally accomplished with css, while interactivity is achieved with javascript.
api:An API is how applications talk to each other. On the web, APIs are commonly used to share data between applications. For example, a weather forecast website might accept a zipcode (sent via an HTTP POST request) and return the weather data for that zipcode, which you could use on your own website. Data is commonly sent via the JSON (or sometimes XML) format, and the API documentation specifies how to request the data, what format to expect, and how the data can be used.
big data:The focus on processing the large datasets now made available by the internet, more standardized data formats allowing for the interchange of data, and the preponderance of storage for the datasets.
recursion:Recursion is a programming concept in which a function, class method, or routine invokes itself to re-apply an algorithm on a different set of inputs. The solution to the problem then may be devised by combining the solutions obtained from the previous iterations of the algorithm in the recursive sequence.
algorithm:In Computer Science, Algorithm is a set of rules or instructions to be followed by a machine/computer to solve a problem. Algorithms are essential to the way computers process data. Many computer programs contain algorithms that detail the specific instructions a computer should perform to carry out a specified task example: employee payroll calculation, etc.
ram:Random Access Memory - The online, volatile memory that is the primary fast storage of computers today. Technically the cache on the chips is even faster and is also random access memory but generally the term is applied to the memory on the motherboard or equivalent in other architectures.
jvm:Java Virtual Machine (Acronym). Part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
python:Python is a high level interpreted language. It's a go-to language for small to mid sized applications because of its concise syntax, strong community, and impressive standard library, among many other things. Especially well suited for science/academia, web development, and isolated scripts, but suffers with enterprise or high performance code because of its simple nature.
angular js:Angularjs is a JavaScript framework used for making dynamic webpages. Unlike other JS frameworks, it has a declarative instead of imperative syntax. Angular is maintained by Google. A common alternative to Angularjs is React.js
static:In Java, the static keyword can be applied to variables, methods, and nested classes within a class. Static means that the variable/method/class belongs to the class itself, and not to a particular instance of the class, i.e. an object. Static methods can only call other static methods and use static variables.
void:Void is a type given on methods in languages like Java and C#. Unlike other types, void doesn't return anything (null).
chrome:Chrome, or Google Chrome, is an internet browser developed by Google.
cookie:A cookie is a small piece of text stored by a browser on a user's computer. Cookies are closely tied to sessions, which store small amounts of user data around relevant website activity (ex: account or shopping cart data). After a cookie is stored and the user returns to the website, the cookie ID is used to fetch the corresponding session (which contains user data) without the user having to log in again.
dns:In short this is the phonebook (if you remember those) of the internet. In stores the translation between human readable URIs (hackterms.com) and the its current IP address. Current is the key word. Often a human readable address will stay the same and it's IP address will change. The system is designed to quickly flow these changes to servers across the world.
graph:A graph is an abstract data type that describes a set of vertices (nodes) and the connections between them (edges). A graph may be a directed graph or an undirected graph. Common representations for graphs include the adjacency matrix and adjacency list.
javascript:Javascript (JS) is a very popular computer language used on the web. All modern browsers come with JS support, making it indispensible in web development. On the front-end, JS can be used to collect user input, process data, and draw and manipulate elements on the screen. Additionally, using Node.js, Javascript can be run on the server. On the back-end, common JS alternatives are Ruby on Rails and PHP. On the front end, popular JS frameworks and libraries include jQuery, React, and Angular.
if else:if else is a very common logic structure in programming, popular across most languages (though the syntax may differ.) It simply says - if (something is true), do this. Otherwise, do something else. For example, IF the user's password is correct, display the profile page. ELSE, display the login form.
null:In most languages, a null value means the value does not exist. It's not empty, 0, or false - it simply doesn't reference anything.
blockchain:A link is only as long as your longest strong chain. Keeping this in mind, a block chain is a set of links, called blocks. Each block links to the block before it via its address. New blocks are constructed by solving a puzzle -- taking the hash of the address of the previous link in the chain, the address of the potential coin owner, and a random filler number called a nonce. Once a block is found (aka mined), that fact is broadcast to all other miners.
binary:Refers to the base two number system which only contains 1 and 0. It works well in computers because it can be represented as on/off, charged/not charged. high/low, true/false or any other mutually exclusive states. A single binary value is a bit with large groups called a nibble, a byte, a word and long word.
http:HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol (a kind of "language" used for communication) used for the World Wide Web. A Web browser requests a page from a website by "speaking" HTTP, and the site responds by "speaking" HTTP as well.
cmd:cmd is the default command prompt for Windows.
basic:basic is a simple,procedural programming langauge.
hash:In cryptography, a hash is a seemingly random string of data that results from a hashing algorithm, which obscures information to keep it secret. Unlike with encryption, this data cannot be un-hashed. A common use case is password storage: when you create an account on a site like Hackterms, your password is stored as a hash (so instead of "password", the database would contain "23ohtt7384f5o91d8239c13029u"). Each time you log in, the program runs your attempt through the same hashing algorithm and checks if the result matches the stored hash.
object:In object-oriented programming (OOP) an object is a structure containing both data (also known as fields, attributes or properties) and code (also known as methods). For example a Dog object may contain the fields breed ("labrador"), colour ("brown") and name ("Fido") as well as methods bark(), eat() and sleep().
code:Formatted text which is usually human-readable, used by tools instruct machines.
memory:Memory is the thing that the computer uses to remember things (duh...). The CPU reads from and writes to memory to do its calculations. The program that is executed is read from memory, the stack that holds your local variables, parameters and return addresses is stored in memory. Even the heap is in memory.
zero indexed:Zero-indexed means the ordering starts at zero. This is common with arrays, where the first element is stored at index 0, the second array at index 1, and so on.
linked list:A library is a collection of pre-written code you can use in your application. Generally, you'll include a library within your application and will then have access to the functions within. Some languages ship with pre-written libraries, while others are open-sourced. Libraries allow you to use pre-written code without "reinventing the wheel". For example, you might use a Math library to avoid having to code equations yourself. Most mature web applications draw heavily on libraries.
error:code doesn't always work correctly, and in most languages, code will break by "throwing" an error (sometimes called an "exception"). Some programmers build custom "handlers" to more gracefully deal with errors (like hiding scary error messages from users, or logging errors to a database).
garbage collection:When a program allocates memory, it needs to be managed somehow. Programming languages with garbage collection manage this automatically, so memory resources that aren't needed are freed up and given back to the operating system.Garbage collection is not as efficient as manual memory management, but prevents memory leaks and generally makes programming easier.
database:Programs often need to store information long-term, or make it accessible to multiple users. A database is a structured repository for holding this information for future retrieval.
git:Git is an open source version control system - it allows you to track all the changes made to any set of files meaning you can go back to previous versions. This also means that it is easier to collaborate with other contributors on the same set of files as you can use Git with many repository hosting providers such as GitHub, GitBucket or VSTS.
library:A library is a collection of pre-written code you can use in your application. Generally, you'll include a library within your application and will then have access to the functions within. Some languages ship with pre-written libraries, while others are open-sourced. Libraries allow you to use pre-written code without "reinventing the wheel". For example, you might use a Math library to avoid having to code equations yourself. Most mature web applications draw heavily on libraries.
encryption:Encryption is the process of transforming readable data ("hello world") into data that is unreadable ("ifmmp xpsme"). Generally, an encryption algorithm is secret, so data can only be decrypted by a trusted party. In this example, the encryption algorithm was simply to advance 1 letter ("h" -> "i", "e" -> "f", etc.), so the decryption algorithm would be going back 1 letter. In the real world, encryption algorithms are far more complex.
array:In most languages, an array is a simple way to store similar items - strings (words), numbers, or even whole objects. Elements in an array are automatically given an index, starting at 0, and then accessed through this index.
throw catch:When code doesn't work properly, it will "throw" an error, which usually outputs a message for debugging and stops the execution of code. However, some languages (ex: Javascript) allow for "catch"ing these errors and dealing with them some other way (or ignoring them!). Many languages also allow for the deliberate "throw"ing of errors.
browser:A browser (like Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, and even Internet Explorer/Edge) is a computer application that lets people view and interact with webpages. You are almost certainly using a browser right now. The way it works is you navigate to a human-readable address (ie, hackterms.com), which is looked up in a Domain Name System (DNS) to find the corresponding IP address (ie, 216.239.34.21).
compiler:A compiler is a program that translates a program text into instructions an actual machine can understand. The input given to a compiler should follow the syntax (and rules) of a given programming language. Compilers can either compile programs to actual processor instructions that can be executed by a real computer (such as the gcc compiler for C), or they can compile programs to a virtual architecture (such as the javac compiler for Java).
front end:Front-end (client-side) programming generally refers to the part of the application the user sees - the interface. Photos, text, logos, buttons, menus - all of these are front-end elements. Front-end developers work on building out the layout and graphic design of the website, and often on designing the interface and user experience design.
c:is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.It is a very popular language, despite being old. The main reason for its popularity is because it is a fundamental language in the field of computer science.C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.
kernel:A kernel is the central part of an operating system. It manages the operations of the computer and the hardware - most notably memory and CPU time. There are two types of kernels: microkernel, which only contains basic functionality; monolithic kernel, which contains many device drivers.
abstraction:Abstraction refers to the process or the result of selecting which details of a certain concept or object are important and not showing or defining the parts that are deemed unnecessary.
false:A value that represents something that is incorrect and not true.
assembler:A program that turns assembly language to machine code that can be executed on a computer. This term may also be used to refer to assembly language itself.
terminal:A terminal is a text-based method of interfacing with a computer. Before computers were fast enough, terminals were physical pieces of hardware - a monitor and a keyboard. Now, terminals are usually emulated as a software program (like iTerm, GNOME Terminal, XTerm, rxvt, or Terminator in Unix-like operating systems). Terminals also define a set of features and how to display those features, like bold or italic fonts, blinking text, and foreground/background colors.
machine learning:Machine learning can refer to any algorithm which "learns" its behaviour from data. Learning could mean several things: it could mean that it optimizes on its performance on some task, or that it finds relationships in the data, or something else. That being said, machine learning is an imprecise, overloaded, and often misused term so you may hear it applied to things that don't really fit this definition as well, and some may disagree that everything captured by this definition is machine learning.
windows:Microsoft OS for desktop / laptop computers.
url:Based on the URI standard, a URL is a standard way to locate a resource. Most people are familiar with web URLs but URLs exist for FTP, Telnet and other services as well.
back end:Back-end (server side) programming refers to the part of a website the client doesn't see - data storage and processing, routing, algorithms and database operations. More precisely, files stored on the back-end are stored on the server, not the user's computer (known as front-end, or client-side).
operatiing system:A computer's operating system (acronym: OS) is software that provides applications a common interface to the underlying hardware including access to input/output devices (keyboards, monitors, speakers, printers), connected networks and file resources. The great advantage of this is that applications written for a specific target OS (like Linux, Windows, DOS, Mac OS) can be executed on any machine that is running the same family of OS without knowing the details about the computer or its hardware.
queue:A data structure that lets you insert ("enqueue") and remove ("dequeue") one item at a time. The first item you insert is the first item you remove; this is called "first in, first out" or "FIFO". Think of a group of people waiting to pay for their items in a shop (a "queue" or a "line"). Enqueuing is like a person entering at the rear, and dequeueing is like a person leaving from the front to pay.
base:foundation or root of something
